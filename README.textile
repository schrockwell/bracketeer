h1. About Bracketeer

Bracketeer is a Java console application that uses year-end team statistics to generate a printable, plain-text bracket for the NCAA Division I basketball tournament.

h1. Running Bracketeer

First navigate to the root source directory and run @ant@ to compile a JAR:

<pre>$ ant</pre>

Now run the Bracketeer, specifying a year, a sex, and the scorer class to use. E.g.

<pre>$ java -jar build/jar/bracketeer.jar 2010 women WomenScorer2010</pre>

If the scorer has generated any other output, it will be found in the @results/@ directory.

h1. Creating Your Own Scorer

Games can be scored in any arbitrary way by simply creating a class in the @bracketeers.algorithms@ package that implements the @bracketeer.algorithms.Scorer@ interface.

Here is the entire Scorer interface:

<pre>public interface Scorer {
	// Expected to set game.scores[], game.winner, game.loser, game.summaryStats, game.summaries
	public void playGame(Game game);
}</pre>
